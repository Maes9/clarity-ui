# Filter Bar

Search + filter dropdowns + active filter chips + result count.

## When to use

Above any data table or list view that needs search and filtering. Pair with DataTable or list-detail layouts.

## Rules

- Search input max-w-sm, left-aligned
- Filter dropdowns use the styled Select component
- Active filters shown as accent-colored chips with × remove
- Result count right-aligned in the chip row: "24 of 156"
- Clear All button appears only when filters are active
