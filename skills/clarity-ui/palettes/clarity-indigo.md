# clarity-indigo

Confident, trustworthy, financial-grade. The default palette.

## When to use

- Fintech, banking, insurance, payments
- Enterprise SaaS, CRM, ERP
- Any B2B product where trust and professionalism matter
- When the user doesn't specify a preference — this is the default

## Personality

Cool indigo accent on clean gray neutrals. The accent is bold enough to draw attention to CTAs and active states, but the overall interface stays restrained and professional. Think: a product you'd trust with your company's data.

## Accent usage

- Primary buttons and CTAs
- Active sidebar nav item background (accent-subtle) with accent text
- Links and interactive elements
- Focus rings
- Selected table rows (accent-subtle background)
- Chart primary color

Do NOT use the accent for:
- Large background areas
- Borders (use border tokens)
- Body text (use fg-secondary)

## Dark mode notes

Accent lightens slightly in dark mode for readability. Background shifts to near-black with subtle blue undertone. Borders become the primary elevation indicator — shadows are near-invisible.
