# clarity-slate

Minimal, focused, engineering-grade. For teams that value function over form.

## When to use

- Developer tools, DevOps dashboards, API platforms
- Project management, issue trackers
- Products with complex workflows where UI should fade into background
- When the user wants a "Linear-like" or "clean minimal" aesthetic

## Personality

Cool slate neutrals with a single blue accent. The interface is almost invisible — it gets out of the way so users can focus on their work. Fewer visual layers, flatter hierarchy. Content is the decoration.

## Accent usage

- Primary buttons (used sparingly — most actions are secondary/ghost)
- Links and interactive elements
- Focus rings
- Selected states
- Active indicators

This palette uses ghost/outline buttons more than filled buttons. Reserve the blue accent for the single most important action on a page.

## Dark mode notes

Slate-blue undertone in dark backgrounds. The palette is designed to look equally good in light and dark — neither mode feels like an afterthought.
