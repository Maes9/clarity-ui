# clarity-warm

Approachable, collaborative, inviting. Professional warmth without being casual.

## When to use

- Collaboration tools, knowledge bases, documentation platforms
- HR tech, team management, internal tools
- Customer-facing dashboards (not just admin panels)
- When the user wants a "Notion-like" or "friendly professional" aesthetic

## Personality

Warm stone neutrals with amber/orange accents. The backgrounds have a barely-perceptible warm tint that makes the interface feel less clinical than pure gray. The amber accent is energetic but professional — it suggests action and warmth without being playful.

## Accent usage

- Primary buttons and CTAs (amber is high-visibility)
- Active states and selections
- Progress indicators
- Notification badges
- Important callouts

Amber works well for CTAs because it naturally draws the eye. Use it confidently for the primary action on each page.

## Dark mode notes

Dark mode uses warm dark stone tones instead of pure black or blue-black. The warmth carries through — it should feel like a dimly lit workspace, not a terminal.
